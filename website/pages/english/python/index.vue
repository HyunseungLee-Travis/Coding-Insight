          Have you ever heard of the word Python?<br /><br />

          If you are thinking about a type of snake named Python, then you are
          incorrect.<br /><br />

          It is not a snake we will be learning today, it is PROGRAMMING!

          <p>
            Programming is a 'language' between machines and humans.<br /><br />

            Similar to people from the U.S. speaking their own language,
            machines have their clever and unique way of communicating.<br /><br />

            It is very important that mechanics are efficient. To make this
            possible, humans invented another language called BINARY CODE which
            is all 0s and 1s. With only 2 possible outcome of a single digit,
            there is less chance of errors and the core can read the command
            faster than 0s and 1s and 2s.<br /><br />

            Programming language is here to help us as a guide between human and
            mechanics world as it is very hard for humans to speak 0s and 1s and
            impossible for computers to learn sophisticated human languages.

        What is the benefits of learning Python?<br /><br />

        Firstly, Python is very easy to learn. If you are new to programming
        languages, you can get started right now with Python in our website!<br /><br />

        Secondly, we can use Python for many needs and jobs. Python is very
        flexible and we can use them in many situations. For example, if we are
        collecting datas from weather reports, we can store that in a file.
        Then, we can draw graphs and make calculation automatically using
        Python. We will learn how to do this in MATPLOTLIB part.<br /><br />

        There are many more reasons to learn Python but we will cut here as the
        two above is the most unique thing about Python.

          <h1>Where did the name 'Python' come from?</h1>
        </div>
        <p style="margin: 5px">
          Python is made by Guido Van Rossum.<br /><br />

          While thinking about the new name of his programming language, Rossum
          had been watching a comedy show by Monty Python. He named his language
          after the last name of the main actor.<br /><br />

          The programming language's name 'Python' does not come from the
          snake.<br /><br />

          If you had been Rossum, about to name the new programming language
          that will change the world, what would you have named it?
