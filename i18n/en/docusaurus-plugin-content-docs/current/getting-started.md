# Before Starting

Before starting, let's talk about 4 languages currently available for learning in Coding-Insight.

## Introduction

## 파이썬

Most programming languages are complex and hard to learn at first, but [Python](/docs/python/start/python) is easier for beginners.

It's simple yet a lot of experienced developers use it because it has many tools and wide community support.

```py
print("Python is easy to learn.")
```

## C/C++

[C/C++](/docs/c-cpp) has been with the developers for 40 years and is one of the most used languages in the world.

However, it is not easy to learn and these days, there may be much more suitable languages for you.

C++ is an upgraded programming language with much more features and tools than c.

```c
printf("C  is the pioneer");
```

```cpp
cout << "C upgraded";
```

## Rust

Most people say [Rust](/docs/rust) is the future of the world as it is simple, powerful, fast and secure.

However, it is not easy to learn as there are more features you need to learn before you can use Rust to build.

```rust
println!("Rust is hard yet one of the best languages")
```
