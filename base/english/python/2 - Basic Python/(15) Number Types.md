There are three types of number in Python.

- integer

Integer is number such as -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. It is a whole number.

```

For example, the number 3.14159 is a float as it is a number between 3 and 4 with more digits after '.'.

```

print(type(floatNumber)) #<class 'float'> is printed
```
