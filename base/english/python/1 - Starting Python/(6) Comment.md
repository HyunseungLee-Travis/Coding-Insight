# What is a comment?

Below YouTube videos, there are sections in which you can 'comment' on the video.

In programming languages, comments is a method to use for various purposes such asexplaining what a code does.

# When to use comment?

1. Explaining what a piece of code does
2. To inform the reader or developer of something
3. Python compiler ignores comments. Try to 'comment' codes out. It removes to code temporarily but we can always restore it.

# One - line comment

One line comment is mostly use beside a code to tell what it does.

Using '#' symbol, we can make a comment for our code.

```
print() # This code puts information to the console
```

# Multi - line comment

Multi line comments are used to inform readers and developers.

We can also use this to remove a code temporarily.

Multi line comments can start from anywhere to any place while one - line comment can only be used in that line.

```
'''

blablabla
this code does not run:
print()

'''
```

We can use """ instead of '''.
