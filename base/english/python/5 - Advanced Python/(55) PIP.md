# What is PIP?

PIP is a program that handles files and modules.

In Python compiler higher than 3.4 will automatically download PIP.

# Check whether PIP is installed

First, press 'windows+r'.

A new window will pop up and type in 'cmd' and press enter.

Next, type in 'pip --version' in the terminal.

If a number appears, you have PIP in your computer!
If error occurs, let's download PIP right now!

# How to install PIP

Back to first when we downloaded Python, open the download page again.

Download Python again.

Then, click on the 'MODIFY' button.

Next, click the 'install pip' option and continue.

Then, open the terminal like we did before (windows+r and type cmd), type in 'pip install pip'.

# PIP install

We can easily install any package in the world using PIP.

Run the command 'pip install packagename' to install a specific pacakge(replace pacakgename with the name of the pacakge).

```
pip install camelcase
```

# PIP uninstall

The 'pip uninstall packagename' will uninstall the pacakge.

```
pip uninstall camelcase
```

# PIP show

To get information about a package such as name, explanation, authors, use the 'show' command.

```
pip show pygame
```

# PIP list

Too see all the modules downloaded on your computer, use the 'pip list' command.
