# Why should we put codes in one line?

Some computers are very slow.

It might be necessary to care about performance of your program/app.

# ; Semicolon

In other programming languages such as JavaScript, there is ';'(semicolon) to seperate code.

It exists in Python, but it is uncommon.

For example, let's look at the code below.

```
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")
```

The code above is equal to the code below.

```
print("Hello", end=" "); print("World")
```

# More explanation

In Python, semicolons are purely optional.

You can use it and not use it.

It does not make a single difference.

Note: you can also put semicolons after each code.

```
print("a");
print("b");
```
