# Problem

If we open up Python IDLE and try to type in an if statement, it is very hard.

This is because we have to think about indentation.

# \

Using backslash will tell Python that the next line will belong to that statement.

So, if we put a backslash after boolean statement, the next line automatically goes inside the if statement.

```
if 1 == 1:\
print("1 is equal to 1")
```

If indentation is difficult and hard to follow, simply use '\'.
