# What is File Handling?

In Python, it is very easy to read, write, append, create and delete files.

In input & output Python page, we learned how to write to files using the print() function.

However, there are much more to it than simply writing to files.

# File Path

File path is the adress of your file in your computer.

To copy your file path, go to VSCode and click right of your mouse on a file and click the button 'copy path'.

# Opening and Closing Files

We can use open() function to open our files.

Then, we will handle that file.

Finally, we always have to close the file by running close() method.

Otherwise, errors might occur.

```
t = open(r")
t.close()
```
