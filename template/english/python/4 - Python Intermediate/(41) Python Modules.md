# TIME

The time module helps us with operations that has to do with times in Python.

`import time`

## sleep()

Using time.sleep(x), we can stop the code for 'x' seconds.

```
import time

time.sleep(3) #stops for 3 seconds then continue.
print("The program is a bit slow")
```

# OS

## What is OS?

OS means the computer software.

Using this module, we can control our system.

`import os`

## OS - clear the terminal

If there are a lot of outputs in Python program, it can get very messy.

os.system("cls") helps us clear our terminal.

Note that depending on your terminal and system, it can be either 'cls' or 'clear'.

```
import os

os.system("cls")
```
